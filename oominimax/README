Running Instructions: Input a command-line argument in the format - python3 oominimax.py

Notes:
OOminimax is an object oriented approach of minimax.py, which is an AI powered tic-tac-toe game. 
OOMinimax utilizes two classes, and two functions, namely:

	-Class Board:
		The first class, 'Board' encapsulates the board which is used to play the Tic-Tac-Toe game. It also hides the working and
		implementation of setting moves on the board, validating the move, and checking if a player has won the game. This class
		solves the problem of calling (and modifying) two global variables, 'state' and 'board' for every function which needs it
		to be a parameter.

	-Class Turns
		The second class, 'Turns' is utilized to set the turn alternatively between the human and the computer. It takes in an
		instance of the board object, and calls several attributes of the object. In addition, for the computer's turn, it also calls
		minimax algorithm to decide the best move to be played for the computer.

	-Minimax
		The Minimax algorithm is the backbone of the computer's decision in this game. Minimax is a recursive algorithm, which builds
		a tree by playing the best possible move for each player, for every possible move on the board, and chooses the shortest path in
		the tree to victory. 

	-Main
		Then main function does the error handling of human input, and checks for each turn whether a player has won or not. It also 
		instantiates a board object and a turns object, and modifies the board instances, and swwitches turns between the human and the AI.

-submit.git.log.txt is a log of all the commits I made to my repository. In order to save the progress I made, and also to track the 
	changes in my code, I committed changes whenever I progressed/ did something functional in my code. There are a total of 9 commits.

-debugger.png is a screenshot of the debugging screen of Wing Personal IDE. 

Assumptions:
There are only two symbols to choose from in this game: X and O.
