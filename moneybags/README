#   Weekly Exercise #7: Dr. Moneybags
# --------------------------------------------

Included Files: - moneybags.py
                - README

Running Instructions: Input a command line argument in the format: python3 moneybags.py
                      Then, simply input a number 'n', which is the number of applicants.
                      Then input the networth of each individual in each line of input.

Notes:

The program moneybags.py takes in a number 'n' which is the number of applicants to the elite club of
Dr. Moneybags. It then takes in 'n' lines of input, each of which describes the net worth of each
applicant.
Moneybags finds the largest number 'N' such that there are atleast N applicants with N million
dollars. This number is also called as the threshold.
moneybags.py is implemented using three functions, namely:

- threshold: This function has the main loop of the program, which finds the threshold of the elite club.
             It first takes the list of the net worths of each person. It then applies sort, to sort the
             list in ascending order. Then it uses a counter, 'm' as the threshold, which is initiated
             as 0. Further, a loop is implemented which checks if there are atleast m applicants with
             m million dollars. With each value of m which is satisfied, m is incremented by 1 and 
             is tested again. Once this condtion fails, the loop is exited, and m is returned.

- moneybags: This function makes and returns moneylist, the list which is used by the above function.
             It takes in the number of applicants, and runs a for loop to get the net worth of each 
             applicant. It then appends the net worth of each applicant to moneylist.

- main: This function returns 'n', the number of applicants which is passed in as a parameter to moneybags.
        It also calls the above two functions, and prints the final output to the terminal.

Assumptions:

Although the program can handle more than the limit, it is assumed that the number of applicants will be lesser
than or equal to 100000. The networth of each applicant is also assumed to be lesser than 1000 million
(0 <= W <= 1000000000). It also assumes that there will be 'n' lines of input after inputting the value of 'n'
i.e each applicant has an associated net worth value.
