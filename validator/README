Weekly Exercise 1: Password Validator

Included File(s):
- validator.py : This .py file contains two functions; namely validate(password) and generate(n)

Notes and Assumptions
The file validator.py contains two functions as mentioned above:

-validate(password) : This function takes in a password, and checks security level of that password based on a few preset guidelines
                      and criteria. It categorizes each input into three categories based on the guidelines:
                      invalid, insecure and secure.

-generate(n) : This function generates a password based on the formerly set guidelines and criteria. To ensure randomness and non-unif-
                ormity, this function shuffles the data set, then picks data accordingly. This function assumes that the argument 'n'
                inputted is greater than 8, and will not work if the value of 'n' is lesser than 8.
