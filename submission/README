Weekly Exercise 2: Unfair Dice

Included File(s):
- README
- unfairDice.py: This file contains two functions, namely biased_rolls and draw_histogram

Notes and Assumptions
The file validator.py contains two functions as mentioned above:

biased_rolls: This function takes in a list of probabilities of each side of an m-sided die, a 'random' seed number and the number 
              rolls to attempt. Depending upon the probability of each side, it then creates intervals which have that corresponding 
              percentage (or share) of the interval [0,1). It then takes the random choice, and checks whether it lies in any of these
              intervals. If it does, it maps it to the side and appends the side to the 'rolls' list. It does this an 'n' number of
              times.

draw_histogram: This function takes in the number of sides of the die, the list of 'rolls', and a maximum scaled width. It plots the 
                frequency of each number which occurs in rolls according to a max scaled width. If the frequency of the number does not
                reach the max scaled width, it fills the corresponding histogram column with hyphens.

This function assumes that the sum of all probabilities in the list 'prob_list' is equal to 1. It also assumes that the length of 
prob_list is equal to the number of sides of the die.
