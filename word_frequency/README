#   Weekly Exercise 3: Word Frequency
# --------------------------------------------

Included Files:
	* freq.py
	* README

Running Instructions: Input a command-line argument in the format -
					  python3 freq.py <input_file_name>
					  (Where <input_file_name> is the name of the file)

Notes:

The file 'freq.py' has three functions in it, namely: 'input_file', 'word_counter', and 'output_file'. The code initially 
starts with a function that reads in the command-line argument provided, and extracts the file name required for input.
The role of the functions are:

input_file: This function first checks if the format of the given command-line argument is valid. If the filename given is
			not valid, it prints an error message and ends the program. Moreover, if there are too many/too few command-line
			arguments, the function prints an error message, the correct format and exits the program. Therefore, the program
			is continued only if the format of the command-line argument is correct, and if the input file exists in the same
			directory.

word_counter: This function handles the making of a word frequency table. It does so by splitting all the words (repetitions
			  included) in the input file and placing them as the elements of a list. It then takes a set which has all the 
			  words (no repetitions), compares the two lists, and counts the frequency in a dictionary. The relative frequency
			  is also calculated the same list and dictionary. Ultimately, we get a dictionary with the word count, and a list
			  with the relative frequency. We then merge the two into a list with the final table.

output_file: This function simply writes the frequency table into an output file, and closes it.

Assumptions:

This program assumes that the input file will be in the same directory of freq.py, and that the input file is in plaintext form.
It also assumes that the output file is empty/does not exist.
