# Compendium Of All Assignments

Note: The mini projects contained in this repository were assignments given as a part of the CMPUT 274 course I took in Fall 2020.
      I would like to thank Dr. Paul Lu, and the CMPUT 274 team for designing and introducing such intuitive assignments, which along
      with being challenging, provided a gentle introduction followed by implementation of many fundamental topics of computing science.

# Assignment Topics and Highlights

Each project file has its own README which provides a detailed expanation of the code. Each assignment encapsulates several fundamental concepts,
mentioned below:

1. Password Validator: Introduction to Functions, Random module
2. Unfair Dice: Probability, Loops
3. Word Frequency: Introduction to Classifiers, Reading/Writing to Files, Word Frequency 
4. Text Proprocessor: Preprocessing, Reading Command-Line Arguments, EOF Handling
5. OO Minimax: Beginner Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Minimax Algorithm, Recursion
6. Moneybags: Efficient Sorting Algorithms, Big-O Complexity
7. Huffman Coding: Intermediate OOP, Compression, File I/O, bitio, Huffman Trees, Binary Search
