# Compendium Of All Assignments

Note: The mini projects contained in this repository were assignments given as a part of the CMPUT 274 course I took in Fall 2020.
      I would like to thank Dr. Paul Lu, and the CMPUT 274 team for designing and introducing such intuitive assignments, which along
      with being challenging, provided a gentle introduction followed by implementation of many fundamental topics of computing science.

This repository contains projects done as assignments of CMPUT 274, a course which I thoroughly enjoyed.

## Assignment Topics and Highlights

Each project file has its own README which provides a detailed expanation of the code. Each assignment encapsulates several fundamental concepts,
mentioned below:

__1. Password Validator:__ Introduction to Functions, Random module 

__2. Unfair Dice:__ Probability, Loops

__3. Word Frequency:__ Introduction to Classifiers, Reading/Writing to Files, Word Frequency 

__4. Text Proprocessor:__ Preprocessing, Reading Command-Line Arguments, EOF Handling

__5. OO Minimax:__ Beginner Object Oriented Programming (OOP), Minimax Algorithm, Recursion

__6. Moneybags:__ Efficient Sorting Algorithms, Big-O Complexity

__7. Huffman Coding:__ Intermediate OOP, Compression, File I/O, bitio, Huffman Trees, Binary Search
